Collected Tales from the World of Iris, as told by Bard of Pearls

9/19/17 - Episode 71: ["Heart of the World, Part 2"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/176102590) - The adventures have never faced an environment so hostile, nor foes more implacable, than those at the Heart of the World. Relentlessly they seek to purge their home of the invaders, and soon, our heroes are worn down by the continual attacks of the Heart's Cells. However, a bit of kindness and a good deal of exploration provides them with the tools they need to pass through the dangers of the Heart unscathed. Formidable foes remain in their paths, but there are far more paths than before and they are much less strenuous.

9/5/17 - Episode 70: ["Heart of the World, Part 1"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/172641067) - At the cusp of the Heart of the World, our heroes rest, contemplating the nature of the verdant temple below and querying the dark nature of the entities that reside within. As they venture towards the ziggurat's entrance, the planet's natural defenses rise, preventing a simple descent. With little hesitation, the adventurer's unleash their full might upon their newly-formed prison, but the planet lashes back in return.

8/1/17 - Episode 69: ["Battle Before the Folded Tree"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/163795795) - On the Isle of the Folded Tree waits Pyroclast Tephra Olivine. She sits, watching the waves, knowing that when her opponent arrives, their journeys will finally end. They will meet. Hopefully her opponent will be a good person, but if they are not, perhaps that will be easier. After all, the only remaining battle is the one that chooses Iris' Champion. Whoever triumphs shall take up that burden and venture into the Folded Tree towards whatever lies within. But for now, she waits. For now, there's peace. She smiles. When the battle is over, there will be peace again.

7/25/17 - Episode 68: "Water, Stone, and Oblivion" - Within the cave of the Obelisk, the Trial of Discovery pits our heroes against riddles in which their very existences are at stake. The vanishing passageways lead to altars of water on which the keys to the final doors lie. Disturbing these altars causes further chaos to break out within the tunnels of the Trial, but by controlling the Obelisk's passages, even that chaos can be put to order. Their control and planning finally allows the adventurers to escape the trial, but does not lead them to where they expect. Instead they stand on an island of many lands, of a folded tree, and of Roam's final contest.

7/11/17 - Episode 67: ["The Trial of Discovery"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/158485517) - After a journey to Phon that felt much longer than it seemed, our heroes arrived at the gates of the City of Roads. In the sacred city of the God Who Walks, all who seek to undertake a journey are given the ability to do so, but the strength to overcome that journey's challenges must be their own. This is all the more true for those selected by the Traveler to experience a Trial. Of the four Trials of the God Who Walks, the adventurers select Discovery, which leads them to a strange, runed obelisk. Staring at the runes creates new paths, but proceeding unto new paths without caution can create pain and terror, as those who are left on the paths as they vanish can tell you.

1/31/17 - Episode 66: ["The Pontare Legacy"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/118864217) - Amak'thos and Rex arrive from a world indescribable to riches unimaginable, yet the Rat King's desire is for a weapon of "ultimate peace." Meanwhile, the legendary guards of Polosk bring great pain upon our heroes, until they take advantage of the ballroom's great columns. Yet the truest conflicts lay in the faith of an assassin named Rex, and the mercy of a storyteller named Roger. The legacies of their fathers led them to this moment; for one, and ending, and for the other... perhaps a new beginning.

1/17/17 - Episode 65: ["The Pontare Contract"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/115531761) - Like all excellent parties, the Autumn's Embrace Ball begins to fray at the edges, to completely unravel. On one side, a performer returns with a speech and a plan, ready to enchant his rival and lead him into the hands of his allies. On another, a battle for freedom leads to a sudden stampede that charges into the Grand Ballroom. Finally, in a distant plane marred by chaos, the passageways of time are pursued, and those who walk them see the passage of both years and possibilities.

Amak'thos and Rex encounter the chaos of the Clockwork Passage, a catalyst of monsters known as the Lapse. Gimble begins with a run-in with his academic disgrace before running headlong into the Ultio Ultonis' clutches with Roam.

12/13/16 - Episode 63: ["Infiltrating Autumn's Embrace"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/107342160) - The party splits in two to investigate the Keep of Duke Quinton Reddard, contractor of the Ultio Ultonis assassins trailing Roger and Rex. One group seeks entry through the Rat King's thieving route: a passage between two clocks, one of which lies in the Duke's vaults. They quickly find that the Clockwork Passage is filled with the violence of grinding gears and winding time. The other group enters through the front gates of the Autumn's Embrace Ball, the Duke's annual celebration. However, enemies and detractors from the party's past emerge to crash the soiree or worse, like sneaking up from behind to end the night swiftly.

12/6/16 - Episode 62: “The Contest of Worthiness” - Roger completes the trials laid before him by the noble houses of Polosk, gaining through his talents access to Duke Reddard’s Autumn’s Embrace Ball.

11/22/16 - Episode 61: ["Uncle Gimble and the Rat King"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/102829569) - On the way back from the markets, Gimble finds himself tackled by an overeager metal child in whose "birth" he played a surprisingly significant part. When he and Roam reconnect with the rest of the party, they head through Granny's house to meet the Rat King in his lair and to hear his proposal for robbing the Duke of Polosk. In order to gain the greatest advantage on Quinton Reddard, our heroes plan a two-pronged attack, one arm of which requires official invitations to the Ball. To receive those invitations, the adventurer's must acquire them through Contests of Strength both magical and martial, to say nothing of the Contest of Worthiness solely for eager performers... 

10/25/16 - Episode 60: ["A City in Autumn's Embrace"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/97190630) - After receiving the thanks and gifts of Dolgenshik, our heroes venture north towards the city of Polosk, where the Duke who has a price on Roger's life that is contracted through Rex's former cohorts resides. They arrive in a city threatened by orcish attack but nevertheless excited by the coming of the Autumn's Embrace Ball at the keep. Some see it as a chance to see royalty up close, but others see it as an extremely beneficial distraction. To learn how they might take advantage of this "distraction," the heroes have a "tryout" for Ripp of the Rodent Clan. Success means a promise to meet the "Rat King." On the other side of town, a mysterious metal relative pursues Gimble with reckless abandon.

In one hall, four adventurers face off against a purple worm in pursuit and the gricks that make the cave their home. In another arena, a paladin of nature and light faces off against a druid of the seething dark and his retinue of beasts. Great power shines forth when needed most and allies arrive when tides take their darkest turns. And when the threats of the desperate are at their most devious, the light is given the chance to show the strength of its convictions.

9/27/16 - Episode 58: ["The Poisoned Branch"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/91809154) - The druid Allovan has a simple plan: enter the caverns beneath Dolgenshik and discover the cause of the deadly quakes. Yet no trek is simple when it requires the travelers to traverse slick rock, avoid entrancing purple lights, and withstand the harm caused by cave-ins. Unfortunately, the greatest dangers come not from the environment, but from the malicious leader that drives Roam into an arena of spiders. Elsewhere, the cause of the quakes is found, and that threat looms large over our heroes while other creatures of the dark rise in their lairs to fight both the monstrous and the mortal intruders.

9/13/16 - Episode 57: ["Dolgenshik Shudders"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/89261328) - The road to Dolgenshik is a peaceful one, but one beset with the milk-white eyes of cowardly crows. Their dark wings do not follow into the Dolgenshik, the City of Shattered Walls, but tremors do instead, shaking the foundations of keeps and citizens alike.

8/30/16 - Episode 56: ["One of Many Crossroads"](https://www.twitch.tv/djforeclosure/v/86709367) - Choices don't come during the easy times. They come in front of the campfires, at the ends of long days. Sometimes, it's impossible to tell the consequences of these choices until far in the future, but we do what's best in the moment. Some of us live with the choices we've already made, the ones that haunt us. Others, they see what's ahead, what awaits them out there in that hopeful not yet. All our heroes know now is that Dolgenshik is their next port of call. What decisions they'll make there is anyone's guess. But today choices were made. We may even know one day if they were good... or bad.
